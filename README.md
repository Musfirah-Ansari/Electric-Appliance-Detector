### This machine learning project utilizes the YOLOv5 object detection model to distinguish between refrigerators and water dispensers in images and videos. It begins by downloading a Kaggle dataset containing annotated images of these appliances and prepares the data for training and validation. YOLOv5 is then employed to train a model with a 99.5% accuracy rate on this dataset. The trained model is subsequently applied to video data to generate bounding boxes around detected objects, effectively identifying and tracking refrigerators and water dispensers within the video frames.
